# Project Top Tunes

This website was a collaboration between Ahmed Ramic, Tyler Bedard, and Bright Abety. We each had assigned roles but also helped eachother where help was needed. We designed this website for all music lovers who likes to search for their songs on different platforms. We used two APIs for this website. The first was from (https://deezer.com) and the second one was from YouTube APIs(https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

Technologies used includes:
HTML, CSS and CSS Framework: Bulma, JavaScript jQuery
Server-Side APIs: Deezer APIs and YouTube APIs

Parts of Website:
1. User is presented with a search bar when the website is open.
2. User can type the name of any artist in the search bar and click search.
3. When the search gets executed, the top 5 songs of the artist that was searched for will appear on the page.
4. User is also presented with a link to a music video of the artist that was searched.
5. All the searches of the user is saved into "Saved Searches" using local storage.
6. User can clear the saved searches from the local storage by clicking on "Clear Searches".

Challenges:

This was our first group project. We learned how to deal with merge conflicts and how to problem solve and debug as a team. Getting both APIs to work on the same website took us more time than we predicted. Once we were able to do this, then we were able to store this array of objects into local storage to make our collection page possible.
