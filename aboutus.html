            <p>Welcome to our website! I'm glad you have navigated over here to learn a little bit about our
                contributions and our fantastic page. We are music fans and have decided to create a website where the
                user could find the top songs to any artist they search and they could save their favorite songs to a
                playlist which could be viewed later. We have decided to split up the tasks to get the website up and
                running as soon as possible so everyone could enjoy it. Bright was in charge of the YouTube API and he
                worked on making it functional with our website. So once a user clicks on one of the top songs, it would
                redirect them to the music video on YouTube. Tyler was in charge of the Deezer API. Deezer is sort of
                like Spotify as itâ€™s a library that contains millions of songs. So when the user searches an artist,
                Deezer is able to pull that specific artist's top songs for the user to see. Then we synchronized the
                YouTube and Deezer APIs so the user could see the top songs of an artist as well as watch the music
                videos on YouTube. Then lastly, (Me) Ahmed worked on making the website come together with the Bulma
                framework. I wanted the user to have a wonderful experience by making the website easy to navigate as
                well as making each page stylish with loads of important functionality and information. In all, we had a
                great time working together and have learned so much throughout the entire process. I hope you have
                enjoyed our website and if you would like to give us any feedback or recommendations then please feel
                free to head over to the contacts page and send us a message. </p>
